# Featurisation-and-Model-Tuning_Semiconductor-manufacturing-process-Yield-Classifier
Domain : Industry<br>
This GitHub repo contains code for building a classifier to predict Pass/Fail yield in semiconductor manufacturing processes, along with feature selection analysis to identify essential signals impacting yield.

## OBJECTIVE :clipboard:
- Develop a classifier for predicting Pass/Fail yield in semiconductor manufacturing processes.
- Implement feature selection techniques to identify essential signals impacting yield.
- Analyze the effectiveness of different feature combinations on yield prediction accuracy.
- Provide a comprehensive toolkit for process engineers to optimize yield and reduce production costs.

## DATA DESCRIPTION :page_with_curl:
The data are in two files - Signal-data-1.csv and Future_predictions.xlsx.
